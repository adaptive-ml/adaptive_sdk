A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments consist of firm and non-cancelable commitments. In certain instances, contractual commitments allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. As of December 31, 2022, we had $108.1 million in other contractual commitments having a remaining term in excess of one year that are non-cancelable.\n\n\n\nLitigation\u2014We are involved in disputes, litigation, and other legal actions. For lawsuits where we are the defendant, we are in the process of defending these litigation matters, and while there can be no assurances and the outcome of certain of these matters is currently not determinable and not predictable, we currently are unaware of any existing claims or proceedings that we believe are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. There are many uncertainties associated with any litigation and these actions or other third-party claims against us may cause us to incur costly litigation fees, costs and substantial settlement charges, and possibly subject us to damages and other penalties. In addition, the resolution of any intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d) litigation may require us to make royalty payments, which could adversely affect our gross margins in future periods. If any of those events were to occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected. Litigation is unpredictable and the actual liability in any such matters may be materially different from our current estimates, which could result in the need to adjust any accrued liability and record additional expenses. We accrue for contingencies when we believe that a loss is probable and that we can reasonably estimate the amount of any such loss. These accruals are generally based on a range of possible outcomes that require significant management judgement. If no amount within a range is a better estimate than any other, we accrue the minimum amount."], ["document", "Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities.

Here are the main differences in how these financial commitments are reported and categorized:\n\n1. **Acquisition-Related Obligations**:\n   - These obligations involve additional payments contingent upon achieving certain technology, development, product milestones, or retaining certain employees from acquired entities. They are not always fixed and can depend on future contingencies or milestones.\n\n2. **Contractual Commitments**:\n   - The company mentions having open purchase orders and commitments with contract manufacturers and component suppliers in the ordinary course of business. A significant portion is non-cancelable and firm. In some cases, there are options to cancel or adjust before firm orders are placed.\n\n3. **Litigation Commitments**:\n   - Litigation obligations are based on current disputes and potential future legal actions. These are contingent in nature as the outcomes are uncertain. The company accounts for these by estimating probable losses, accruing liabilities when losses are deemed likely and reasonably estimable.\n\n4. **Funding Commitments**:\n   - The company has certain funding commitments primarily related to privately held investments. These can be contingent on the achievement of milestones or may be required on demand, showing a mix of fixed commitments and contingent obligations.\n\n5. **Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**:\n   - Investments in unconsolidated variable interest entities and customer financings are considered off-balance sheet. These are evaluated for materiality but are structurally separate from the primary financial statements.\n\nIn summary, acquisition-related obligations are generally contingent upon future events, whereas contractual commitments often involve more fixed or non-cancelable obligations. Litigation commitments are contingent and depend on the outcome of legal proceedings. Funding commitments involve both contingent and on-demand obligations, and off-balance sheet arrangements involve separate entities not included in the main financial statements."], "metadata": {}}

Lease receivables represent sales-type leases resulting from the sale of Cisco's and complementary third-party products and are typically collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Lease receivables consist of arrangements with terms of four years on average. Loan receivables represent financing arrangements related to the sale of our hardware, software, and services, which may include additional funding for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. Loan receivables have terms of three years on average. Financed service contracts include financing receivables related to technical support and advanced services. Revenue related to the technical support services is typically deferred and included in deferred service revenue and is recognized ratably over the period during which the related services are to be performed, which typically ranges from one year to three years."], ["document", "During the third quarter of 2022, Evergy Missouri West, MPSC staff and other intervenors in the case reached several non-unanimous partial stipulations and agreements to settle certain issues in the case. In September 2022, the MPSC issued an order approving the partial non-unanimous stipulations and agreements.\n\nIn December 2022, the MPSC issued an amended final rate order settling the remaining issues in the case, including the treatment of Evergy Missouri West's unrecovered investment in Sibley Station. The order and prior partial stipulations and agreements approved by the MPSC provide for an increase to Evergy Missouri West's retail revenues of $30.1 million after rebasing fuel and purchased power expense. The order determined that Evergy Missouri West will be allowed to collect $182.3 million ($173.6 million attributable to Sibley Unit 3) from customers over a period of eight years as a recovery of its existing investment in Sibley Station but will not be allowed to collect the return on its unrecovered investment in Sibley Station. The order also required Evergy Missouri West to refund to customers all revenues collected from customers for return on investment, non-fuel operations and maintenance costs and other costs associated with Sibley Station following its retirement in November 2018 over a period of four years. Also included in the final order was a disallowance related to the recovery of costs associated with the replacement of certain electric meters."], ["document", "Asset class portfolio weights are permitted to range within plus or minus 3%. Where approved by the fiduciary investment committee, futures contracts are used for portfolio rebalancing and to reallocate portfolio cash positions. Where authorized, a few of the plans' investment managers employ limited use of derivatives, including futures contracts, options, options on futures and interest rate swaps in place of direct investment in securities to gain efficient exposure to markets. Derivatives are not used to leverage the plans or any portfolios.\n\nDetermination of the Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Assets\n\nThe overall expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption is based on the long-term target asset allocation for plan assets and capital markets return forecasts for asset classes employed. A portion of the PBOP trust asset returns are subject to taxation, so the expected long-term rate of return for these assets is determined on an after-tax basis.\n\nCapital Markets Return Forecasts"], ["document", "| -                         | -                         | -                         | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   | Years Ended December\u00a031,                   |\n| -                         | -                         | -                         | 2021                                       | 2021                                       | 2021                                       | -                                          | -                                          | -                                          | FY 2021 vs. FY 2020                        | FY 2021 vs. FY 2020                        | FY 2021 vs. FY 2020                        | -                                          | -                                          | -                                          | 2020                                       | 2020                                       | 2020                                       |"], ["user", "\nWhat are the key differences in operating lease obligations between these two companies, considering that Company 1 has $80 million in obligations through 2025 while Company 2 has $244,531 million extending beyond 2027?"]], "completion": ["assistant", "Based on the provided documents, here are the key differences in operating lease obligations between the two companies:\n\n1. **Total Obligation Amounts**:\n   - **Company 1**: Has a total operating lease obligation of $80 million through 2025.\n   - **Company 2**: Has a total operating lease obligation of $244,531 million, extending beyond 2027.\n\n2. **Time Horizon**:\n   - **Company 1**: The lease obligations are set to end by the year 2025.\n   - **Company 2**: Obligations extend well beyond 2027, indicating long-term commitments.\n\n3. **Scale of Commitments**:\n   - **Company 1**: Has significantly smaller lease obligations compared to Company 2.\n   - **Company 2**: The obligations are substantially larger, suggesting a greater reliance on long-term leasing arrangements.\n\nUnfortunately, the specific names of the companies are not provided in the documents, so they are referred to as Company 1 and Company 2."], "metadata": {}}
